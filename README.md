WHAT THE PROJECT IS ABOUT-
Karamoja, located in northeastern Uganda, is renowned as the most food-insecure region in the country. The primary contributors to this food insecurity are recurrent droughts and frequent pest and disease outbreaks, which significantly diminish crop productivity. Despite the efforts of various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that offer technical support and farm inputs to improve yields, there is a substantial lack of comprehensive, real-time data on the overall agricultural conditions in the region. These NGOs often rely on localized information sources to direct their interventions.

This project aims to provide a foundational visualization tool that will aid in more informed decision-making and resource allocation for improving food security in Karamoja.
